public class WaysOfConstruct {
    //Given an array of n integers called required_sums, there is another array of n integers called result that can be constructed to meet the following conditions:
    //The values are non-decreasing, i.e., result[i] ≥ result[i-1] (1 ≤ i < n).
    //The sum of digits of result[i] = required_sums[i] for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
    //result[i] ≤ 5000, for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
    //Find the number of distinct ways that result can be constructed to satisfy the constraints. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo (10⁹ + 7).
    //Note: Two arrays a and b of length n are distinct if a[i] is not equal to b[i] for at least one i in 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
    //Example
    //There are n = 3 elements with the required sums of digits, required_sums = [30, 31, 31].
    //These are the arrays that satisfy the conditions:
    //result = [4988, 4999, 4999]
    //result = [4989, 4999, 4999]
    //result = [4899, 4999, 4999]
    //result = [3999, 4999, 4999]
